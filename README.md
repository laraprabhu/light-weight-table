# Light weight table - React

Came across a professional website that used a table with fixed colums and lazy loaded rows. Became curious about it and wanted to implement the same in react. Implemented it. New things learned: intersectionObserver, resizeObserver, position-sticky (css).

This table can do the following,

* Handles dynamic column definitions and its data.
* Users can configure sticky row header.
* Users can configure sticky columns (any number of columns).
* Handles static data lazy load for better user experience.
* All the above said functionalities are responsive.
